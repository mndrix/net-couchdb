* request design documents without encoding the internal '/' (this is because
  of a change to the CouchDB API)

* implement $document->attachment('name') for fetching attachments

* auto-guess attachment content type for scalar content

* prepare the distribution for the first release to CPAN,
  reread the docs

------------------------ Release to CPAN -----------------

* implement $document->attachments() which returns a list of Attachment
  objects representing the attachments for this document.  Be lazy about
  fetching the attachment content since it could be quite large

* don't let CouchDB create new document IDs.  Instead, create them ourselves
  and give them to CouchDB.  See
  mid:6E29F30A-62C7-40FE-BEA2-BE5EFB89DF4C@apache.org on the couchdb-dev
  mailing list for details.

* implement an API for accessing temporary views.  Views should be
  represented as an object.  Performing operations on a view like
  'start_key="bar"&end_key="foo"' should return a ViewResult object
  which encapsulates a specific subset of all the view results.
  As a proving ground for the API, reimplement all_documents() using
  this new API.

* support fetching many documents with a single HTTP request.  Was this
  called _load_docs?  It should be a fairly new feature on trunk
  Yuval says that he has @ids and wants to get @documents with one HTTP
  request.

* support $document->purge.  See Damien's post to the couchdb-dev
  mailing list with details.  The docs should clearly indicate that
  the method should not be used frequently and that delete() is
  preferred.

* implement an API for creating design documents and saved views

* implement $couch->replicate() to replicate this database to a remote
  server

* implement $couch->restart() to restart the server remotely

* $server->version should return a version object which can be compared
  numerically but which stringifies to the raw version number that the server
  returned.  This will be handy to support any changes to the CouchDB REST API.

* implement $db->slice_documents which calls _all_docs with "start_key"
  and "count" arguments and returns only a subset of the total documents
  (this probably shouldn't be a method of its own.  it's probably a
  method on a View object since they all implement this same interface)

* perhaps implement $document->undelete which undeletes a document by
  using the bulk() feature


# The following methods involve revisions.  Since revisions are
# meant to be an implementation detail and should not be relied upon
# these methods might not be worth implementing
# See http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/DocumentRevisions

* implement $document->latest which returns a document object representing
  the most recent revision of the current document. this is just:
  $self->db->document( $self->id ).

* implement $db->document({ id => $id, rev => $rev })

* implement $document->revisions which returns a list of document objects
  representing all the revisions available for this particular document
